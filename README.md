# Portfolio

# 👋 Hi! I'm Elena Núñez

I'm just starting out in web development. I'm currently taking an **eFundae course on Web Programming Languages**, with which I want to master the world of programming.

This repository is my first portfolio, where I'll be uploading the projects I complete throughout my training and learning journey.
